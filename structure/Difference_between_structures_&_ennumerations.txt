Enumeration is a collection of named constants. Similar to integral numbers. But represented with names.

Structures is compound which can store multiple related data (fields) with different data types to represent an object.

They are unrelated.  A structure is a way to store data. An enumeration is fixed data values.

Enumerated types ( enum ) are quite different from struct and unions. An enumerated type is a data type where every possible value is defined as a symbolic constant. ... Structures do not define lists of constants. A structure can contain enumerations, but an enumeration cannot contain structures.
